##REPORT GENERATOR                                                                                               

This program can be used to generate reports based on Excel files prepared. Input files have to contain **`date`/`task`/`time(h)`** columns. 

Users can create three report types:

- **Report 1** - contains time for given projects

   Example:  

   `Project 1 - 30h`

   `Project 2 - 50h`

- **Report 2** - contains total developers working time and their time devoted to specific projects

   Example:

   `Jan Kowalski - 30h`
   ```
           Project 1 - 20 h
           Project 2 - 10 h
   ```

   `Paulina ≈ölimak - 50h`

   ```
           Project 1 - 20 h
           Project 2 - 30 h
   ```

- **Report 3** - contains projects list sorted by longest time to shortest including tasks in specific projects, also sorted by time

   Example:

   `Project 1 - 130h`
   ```
           Task 1 - 100 h
           Task 2 - 30 h
   ```

   `Project 2 - 90h`
   ```
           Task 1 - 60 h
           Task 2 - 30 h
   ```

### Usage
